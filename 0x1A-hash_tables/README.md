A hash code is a numeric value generated by a hash function from an input data (such as a string, object, or file). The purpose of a hash code is to represent the input data in a condensed and unique manner. Hash codes are widely used in computer science for various purposes, including indexing, data retrieval, and data integrity checks.


A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that provides efficient key-value pair storage, retrieval, and lookup operations. It is widely used in computer science and is designed to optimize the speed of data access by using a technique called hashing.

In a hash table, data is organized into an array-like structure called the "bucket array" or "hash array." The key idea behind a hash table is to use a hash function to map the input key to an index within the range of the bucket array. This index determines the bucket where the corresponding value will be stored or retrieved.
