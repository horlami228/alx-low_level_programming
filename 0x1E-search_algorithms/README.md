# Searching Algorithm

A search algorithm is designed to solve a search problems.

There is a target value or information that is been retrieved from a data structure where it is stored.

## Categories of Search Algorithm
 1. Sequential Alogorithm
 2. Interval Algorithm

> * Sequential is done by going through each element in the data structure one by one until the target is found. And if it reaches the end of the list it returns a failure

> * Interval search is far more faster than Sequential and it for a sorted list where the data structure is divided into the center half for searching and depending on the search value, we can either go left which is lower in the divided list or go right which is values greater than the divided list.
