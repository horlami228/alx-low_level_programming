Learning about the linked list data structure in C

in this project we took on several doubly linked list code problems

A doubly linked list contains a node with data and a pointer to the next and previous nodes in the list


we wrote a function to print every elements in the list
we added a node at the beginning of linked list
we added a node at the end of a linked list
we added a node at a specific index in the list
we created a function to free the allocated memory to avoid leakages
we deleted a node at a specific index in the list
